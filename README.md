## Context

This game is an adaptation of the card game of the same name Ohanami. The development took place over 1 month at the end of 2019 when I started learning web development. It was pretty challenging to create a correct AI, but at the end it's challenging to beat the computer, so far so good.

## Presentation

In Ohanami, the player faces the computer in a card game inspired by Japanese gardens. The player has 3 seasons to design 3 gardens in front of him by harmoniously combining water, stone, vegetation and, of course, Sakura (cherry blossom).

Each garden is an ascending row of cards where a new card can only be placed below or above. The player places 2 cards from their hand in their gardens and passes the rest of their hand to the computer until all the cards are in the gardens.

The game feature 3 game modes and 3 levels of difficulty for the computer. If you want to try your luck you should carrefuly read the ingame instructions first!
